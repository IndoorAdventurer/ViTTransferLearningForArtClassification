\section{Methods}

% Experiments build upon Sabatelli et al.

\subsection{Dataset}
% Mention the challenges and show the table, of course. Also add max and min classes per category to the table maybe
% Don't forget to tell that images get scaled and cropped to 224 * 224 size and imagenet normalized
% Dataset described in more detail in Appendix A, including histograms and confusion matrices + balancing 'algorithm'

\subsection{Models}
% General information (4 per type, base/tiny etc)
% Paragraph/section about CNN models
%  - ResNet50 and VGG19 best fine-tuned and ots networks in Sabatelli
%  - ResNet50 I think also used in medical imaging paper; ResNet101 ots vit paper
%  * Convnext and EfficientNetV2 to have some more modern ones in the mix (to make comparison more fair)
% Paragraph/section about ViT models -- explain the idea behind each in 1 sentence maybe (also for CNNs)
